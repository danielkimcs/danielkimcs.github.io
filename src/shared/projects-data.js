            description: `<h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This is a 353-page textbook that covers mostly precalculus topics with some introductory calculus and more advanced topics often left out of a typical high school curriculum. In particular, this text emphasizes mathematical proof, with an abundant supply of theorems, lemmas, and exercises. The main purpose is to aid readers who wish to learn precalculus and advanced supplemental topics through a more theoretical and abstract perspective and challenge their mathematical critical thinking skills beyond computations.</p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>A few weeks into the class titled "Advanced Precalculus with Discrete Topics," I, a high school sophomore at the time, found its emphasis on proofs and mathematical rigor challenging. To keep up, I updated my stack of personal notes, digitized via <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, daily. Not only did I come to appreciate learning <em>why</em> formulas worked, but I also loved explaining concepts clearly.</p>
            <p>My notes quickly piled up, leaving me to wonder what I could possibly do with them. As the class did not follow an official textbook, I realized that my notes could serve as a useful resource for future students. After months of revising and discussing with teachers, I eventually published a textbook, now available for purchase online on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578479435/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_cnQ.EbRMQZRY3">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/advanced-precalculus-daniel-kim/1131129402?ean=9780578479439">Barnes & Noble</a>, <a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/advanced-precalculus_michael-abramson_daniel-kim/20883506/#isbn=0578479435">ThriftBooks</a>, <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Advanced-Precalculus-Daniel-Kim/9780578479439">Book Depository</a>, and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=53ljwwEACAAJ&sitesec=buy&source=gbs_buy_r">more</a>.</p>`,

Previously, we relied on mass emails to get the latest information on our upcoming meetings and contests and received lecture notes, problem sets, and past contest papers via email attachments. This meant that we often had to refer back to our inboxes and save attached files to our computers locally.</p>

        //     <p>A single website that any student or teacher can access would handle these inconveniences. Students can visit the website’s Archive page to work on past problem sets or the Updates page to read the latest news. The site also provides links to various resources to aid members in contest preparation. In addition, outsiders interested in our program now have a front-end to look at.</p>
