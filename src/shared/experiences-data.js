I automated deployment of nodes over remote resources via Python on Grid'5000 (a testbed for experiment-driven research), ran experiments with R-Pulsar (an Edge Framework developed by RDI2), and analyzed datasets via batch processing (Python - Numpy) and stream processing (Apache Flink). I learned a lot about computer networks, distributed systems, and cloud computing."
